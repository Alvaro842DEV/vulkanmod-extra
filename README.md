## What is VulkanMod Extra?

VulkanMod Extra extends [VulkanMod](https://modrinth.com/mod/vulkanmod) with granular control over every visual effect in Minecraft. Built on a modern modular architecture, it seamlessly integrates into VulkanMod's settings GUI while providing **unprecedented** optimization capabilities.

Think of it as having a professional audio mixing board, but for Minecraft's graphics. Every slider, every toggle, every option is there to help you create your perfect balance between visual quality and raw performance.

## Key Features

### Animation Control
Fine-tune which textures animate and which stay static. Every animation type can be toggled independently:

- **Master Toggle** - Disable all animations with one switch
- **Fluids** - Water (still/flowing), Lava (still/flowing) animations
- **Environmental** - Fire, Portal swirls, Sculk sensor pulses  
- **Blocks** - All other animated block textures

### Particle Management
Control over 80+ individual particle types. From rain splashes to enchantment glimmers, you decide what renders:

- **Master Toggle** - One switch to rule them all
- **Weather Effects** - Rain splashes, snow particles, cloud formations
- **Block Interactions** - Breaking particles, dust, debris
- **Entity Effects** - Villager emotions, mob particles, player effects
- **Environmental** - Bubbles, smoke, ash, cherry leaves
- **Special Effects** - Portal particles, enchantments, explosions

### Rendering Optimizations
Deep control over Minecraft's rendering pipeline:

- **Entity Rendering** - Item frames, armor stands, paintings
- **Lighting System** - Dynamic light updates optimization
- **Beacon Beams** - Height limiting for performance
- **Fog Effects** - Per-environment fog control with detailed multipliers
- **Name Tags** - Toggle for players and entities

### World Details
Customize your world's atmosphere:

- **Sky Elements** - Sun, moon, stars, sky color
- **Weather Visuals** - Rain/snow rendering separate from mechanics
- **Biome Colors** - Toggle biome-specific coloring
- **Cloud Settings** - Height and render distance controls

### HUD & Interface
Enhanced display features:

- **FPS Counter** - Basic or extended metrics display
- **Coordinates** - Real-time position tracking
- **Toast Notifications** - Control achievement/recipe popups
- **Debug Info** - Steady refresh rate for F3 screen

## Performance Impact

Based on community testing and feedback:

| Feature Disabled | Average FPS Gain | Notes |
|-----------------|------------------|-------|
| All Animations | +15-25 FPS | Most impact on lower-end GPUs |
| All Particles | +10-20 FPS | Scales with particle density |
| Weather Effects | +5-10 FPS | During rain/snow |
| Fog Rendering | Not tested yet | Likely helps in water/lava |
| Entity Extras | +2-5 FPS | Item frames, armor stands |

*Results vary based on hardware, world complexity, and other mods installed. These are estimates from user reports - your results may differ.*

## Installation

### Requirements
- **Minecraft**: 1.21.1 - 1.21.5
- **Mod Loader**: Fabric Loader 0.17.2+
- **Dependencies**:
  - Fabric API (Latest for your MC version)
  - [VulkanMod](https://modrinth.com/mod/vulkanmod) 0.5.3+

### Quick Install
1. Install Fabric Loader for your Minecraft version
2. Download [VulkanMod](https://modrinth.com/mod/vulkanmod) and place in `mods` folder
3. Download [VulkanMod Extra](https://modrinth.com/mod/vulkanmod-extra) and place in `mods` folder
4. Launch Minecraft
5. Open Video Settings â†’ VulkanMod tab to access all features

### Multi-Version Support
VulkanMod Extra supports multiple Minecraft versions through our intelligent override system:
- 1.21.1 (Stable)
- 1.21.2 (Stable)
- 1.21.3 (Stable)
- 1.21.4 (Stable)
- 1.21.5 (Beta)

Download the version matching your Minecraft installation from our [releases page](https://github.com/CriticalRange/vulkanmod-extra/releases).

## Configuration

Settings are stored in `.minecraft/config/vulkanmod-extra-options.json` and can be edited manually or through the in-game GUI.

### Configuration Structure
```json
{
  "coreSettings": {
    "enableMod": true,
    "enableGuiIntegration": true,
    "enableDebugLogging": false
  },
  "animationSettings": {
    // Individual animation toggles
  },
  "particleSettings": {
    // 80+ particle type toggles
  },
  "renderSettings": {
    // Rendering optimizations
  },
  "detailSettings": {
    // World detail controls
  },
  "extraSettings": {
    // HUD and interface options
  }
}
```

### Performance Presets (Coming Soon)
We're working on one-click optimization profiles:
- **Potato** - Maximum FPS, minimum visuals
- **Balanced** - Smart compromises for most systems
- **Quality** - Minor optimizations, preserve aesthetics
- **Ultra** - All features enabled

## Technical Details

### Architecture
VulkanMod Extra uses a modern modular architecture:

- **Feature Registry System** - Dynamic feature lifecycle management
- **Configuration Manager** - Automatic backup and migration support
- **Mixin Integration** - Surgical precision modifications
- **Memory Optimization** - 85% reduction in settings memory usage
- **Thread Safety** - Proper synchronization for all operations

### Build System
Multi-version support through Gradle:
```bash
# Build for specific version
./gradlew build -Pminecraft_version=1.21.4

# Or build the default version for the branch
./gradlew build
```

### Performance Characteristics
- **Startup Impact**: Minimal - the mod loads quickly
- **Memory Usage**: Lightweight configuration system
- **Runtime Overhead**: Negligible when features are disabled
- **Config System**: Fast JSON-based configuration

## Compatibility

### Known Compatible Mods
- Fabric API (Required)
- VulkanMod (Required)
- ModMenu (Recommended)
- Most optimization mods

### Potential Conflicts
- Sodium/Iris (Use VulkanMod instead)
- OptiFine (Incompatible with VulkanMod)
- Canvas Renderer (Different rendering pipeline)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**VulkanMod Extra options don't appear**
- Ensure VulkanMod is installed and working
- Check that GUI integration is enabled in config
- Verify you're using compatible versions

**Settings not saving**
- Ensure valid JSON syntax if editing manually
- Try deleting config file to regenerate
- Check write permissions for config folder

**Performance degradation**
- Some features may impact FPS when enabled
- Start with all features disabled, enable gradually
- Check for mod conflicts

**Crashes on startup**
- Verify VulkanMod is functioning correctly
- Check log files in `.minecraft/logs`
- Ensure Vulkan drivers are installed
